A proper understanding of the circulation and diversity of processes occurring in the ocean requires the conjunction of observational, numerical, and theoretical studies. 
Knowledge of these processes will allow us to better manage our ocean resources, as well as deepen our understanding of the Earth's climate and its variability. 
Of particular importance for Mexico is the Gulf of Mexico, since it has an important influence on the weather and climate of the region, in addition to representing a very valuable source of natural resources with great ecological, economic and social value.
